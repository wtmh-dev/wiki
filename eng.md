### People will have to go

Simon Ball, the general manager of a company that is facing serious difficulties has a strenuous task ahead of him.
He has called a meeting with the Human Resources Manager, Peter Hey,
and a union representative, Jane Stokes. He has to tell them that the only option they have to keep their company afloat is to lay people off.
S.B.: Good morning.
P.H., J.S.: Good morning
S.B.: You undoubtedly know why I’ve called you all together this morning. The company has been struggling for some time now. Last year our profits fell by 15% and the prospects for this year are no better. We expect a second decrease of 15%.
S.B.: That’s why I’ve decided that we can only save our company by laying some people off. The question is obviously who and that’s why I’ve asked Peter to draw up a list of people who we might make redundant.
P.H.: I have three copies here in front of me.
J.S.: Before we run through the list I would like to know how many people will have to go to make the company profitable again.
S.B.: Given that we are a small company I think that 3 people should suffice.
P.H.: I am of the opinion that it would be easiest to make 3 manual workers redundant.
J.S.: No, I don’t agree with that. I don’t agree with the fact that only manual workers have to bear the consequences of a fall in profit.
S.B.: I fully understand you, Jane, and you’re entirely correct. The redundancies will have to be distributed equally between manual workers and executive personnel.
P.H.: That’s all well and good, but redundancy pay-outs to executives would cost the firm a lot more money.
J.S.: That’s true, but you have to look at it from a human point of view. In the end, it’s not the fault of the manual workers that the company is in trouble!
P.H.: That’s all very well in theory, but we are a company and not a charity. We have a duty to our shareholders to make as much profit as possible and to do this I firmly believe that we should keep our costs to a minimum. We are operating in an extremely competitive market and by taking difficult decisions now, we will ensure that we’ll be able to grow and prosper in the future.
S.B.: Ok, let's try and keep calm. The issue is sufficiently sensitive as it is. I realise that making executive-level personnel redundant is expensive, but I also believe that we have a duty to be honest and fair towards all of our employees.
S.B.: I think we all agree that regrettably, some people will have to be made redundant. We can meet again in a few days’ time to discuss who exactly those people will be.
